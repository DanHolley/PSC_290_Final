High r-squared values indicate the high correlations 
Thus, videos having more motions should produce higher r-squared than the vidoes with less motions.
Given the r-squared are computed between frames on pixals... all the r-squred should have high values!!
Probably no need to nomalize the r-squared before the log-transformation
Pinpoint the problemic video frame!! (given some frames have lower r-sqaured which should not happen) and plot them!
